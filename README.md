## Project Description

Using React Native, I have build an Android application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. 

The application is tested;
- Xiaomi Mi5 Prime  Android 8.0.0 OPR1 MIUI Global 10.2
- IPhone 8 IOS 13.5.1

## Usage

The project can be run with npm or yarn
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

This will open Expo Developer Tools in the browser.  You can then do one of the following.

- Use your device to test:

    Scan the QR Code using the Expo Client app ([Expo Client for Android & iOS](https://expo.io/tools#client))  from an Android or iOS device.
- Use an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator to run the app:
    - [iOS Simulator Setup](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v33.0.0/introduction/installation/#ios-simulator)
    - [Android Emulator Setup](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v33.0.0/introduction/installation/#android-emulator)

or You can use following commands for directly open your Emulator
